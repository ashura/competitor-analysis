## Technical Strength

Aquafil S.p.A. demonstrates significant technical strength and competitiveness rooted in pioneering circular economy practices, innovation in product development, and environmental leadership within the synthetic fibers and polymers industry. The company's core technological asset is the ECONYL® Regeneration System, an advanced process launched in 2011 that transforms pre- and post-consumer waste (like old carpets, fishing nets, and textile scraps) into regenerated nylon. This closed-loop, chemical recycling technology allows nylon to be continuously recycled without loss of quality, cementing Aquafil’s global leadership in sustainable yarn production. ECONYL® has become a recognized ingredient for more than 1,900 brands worldwide and accounted for 54.8% of Aquafil's total fiber sales in 2024, with a target of 60% by 2025.

To maintain its technological leadership, Aquafil continues to invest in research and development (R&D), allocating €8.2 million in 2024 (1.5% of sales), with projects beyond ECONYL®, such as improving recycling technologies for multilayer carpets and chemical recycling of PET plastics. The company standardizes and measures environmental performance rigorously—evidenced by life cycle assessments, product certifications (OEKO-TEX, Cradle to Cradle, ECO Passport, REACH compliance), and international standards development (e.g., contributing to ISO 4484-2 for microplastics measurement).

Aquafil’s value proposition is strengthened by:
- High vertical integration in waste collection, with in-house and global partnerships (e.g., Healthy Seas, Nofir, Atando Cabos)
- Advanced digitalization in production and quality control
- Diverse product applications (carpet yarn, clothing yarn, engineering plastics)
- Recognized ESG performance, including a Sustainalytics Risk Score of 11.3 (low risk), EcoVadis silver medal, and inclusion in ESG Identity Corporate Index 2024

The company’s technical and organizational robustness is supported by an integrated management system (ISO 9001, 14001, 45001, 50001, SA 8000), strong ESG governance (dedicated committees and clear executive responsibility), and a skilled R&D workforce. Recent technical milestones include:
- The MAGRITTE project, developing 3D printable, recyclable materials from ECONYL®
- New pilot plants for chemical recycling of PET and innovative separation technologies for carpets
- Circular design partnerships in sectors such as aquaculture (first fully recyclable fishing nets) and marine industry carpets

Through this multifaceted innovation, rigorous process management, and commitment to circularity, Aquafil sustains a unique competitive advantage among global synthetic fiber producers.
