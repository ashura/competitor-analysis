## Testimonials

Some customer feedback about Pinacho lathes can be found on Reddit:

1. "I have an Ajax AJEV 225 which is a Pinacho Smartturn 225 with different badges. I got it 2nd hand with 300 hours on it and have put 800 hours on it myself and so far what's wrong with it is the turret does not align properly when changing tools and the X axis belt has snapped twice. Conclusion is its ok if you don't abuse it but it is definitely not for production."

2. "Pinacho.. It got crooked just from breathing to hard in the same direction. It was so weak and awful..and had to scrap parts a lot of times because the turret had twisted out of alignment again."
