## Testimonials

1. "I see a lot of you using WIMA caps and I know they look pretty and red but I would like people's opinions on if they are worth the extra money compared to the typical JB, Arcotronics, or Kemet caps. I hear talk that the WIMAs have a 'tighter' sound but looking for observations."

2. "For builds that are going up for sale, though, I’ll always go for brand names. Wima or Vishay for box caps. This is more to do with presentation and sales blurb than anything. I’ve been doing this ever since I saw the insides of a 1981 DRV. It looks neat."

3. "Film caps are nice. We stock WIMA and EPCOS, the main difference being the WIMA caps are available in much smaller values (pF range) and are often much higher voltages. The EPCOS are available up to 1uF and lower voltage (both more than plenty for pedals). EPCOS are a much smaller package size due to the voltage, so I prefer them whenever available."
