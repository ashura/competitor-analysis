## Testimonials

Here are customer testimonials for Ultrasonic Power Corporation, sourced from their official website ([Testimonials](https://www.upcorp.com/ultrasonic-power-corporation-testimonials/)):

> **Dana Hofer, Dana Hofer Brass Instrument Repair, Inc.:**
> "Here at Dana Hofer Brass Instrument Repair in Chicagoland, we use the 90 Gallon Capacity Ultrasonic Cleaner. In 8 years this machine has cleaned over 8000 instruments. The sonic cleaner is easy to maintain, and is so efficient that it speeds up the cleaning process, allowing us to service over 100 instruments a month to a high level of cleanliness. I look forward to using the Ultrasonic Cleaner for many years to come."

> **Derrick Murphy, Director of Bands, Burlington Community HS:**
> "The alto ultrasonic cleaner has proven to be a great investment and has exceeded all of my expectations. It is simple to use and doesn't take up too much space. It has proven to be an invaluable resource in keeping our smaller instruments and mouthpieces clean and safe for student use. I wish I would have purchased one years ago."

> **Phil Hewitt, Hewitt's Music Inc.:**
> "We have since repaired thousands of instruments across southeast Michigan. The original ultrasonic cleaning machine is a true asset to any successful repair shop."

> **Harry Robertson, Owner, Robertson's Music:**
> "It is one of my best purchases ever. It's getting quite a workout here and is performing better than I even expected."

> **Gerry Evoniuk, Desert Winds Music, Inc, Tempe, AZ:**
> "My ultrasonic cleaner is one of the best tooling investments I've made. My only regrets are that I didn't have the space for the large one and that I didn't buy it 25 years earlier. There's not a day that goes by that it's not in use and we're only a 2 person shop! It paid for itself the first year!!"

> **Lindy Wunn, Wunn Music Repair, Portland, OR:**
> "I absolutely love it. It was the best investment I have ever made in my entire career. It has saved me time, money, effort, and energy."

> **Gary Sage, Owner, Sage Music Service:**
> "With the introduction of our ultrasonic cleaner...it also works well on woodwinds. It gets the 'Gunk' out and has proven to be more sanitary for those who play band instruments."

> **Jerry Disney, Stateline Inst. Repair, Inc.:**
> "Your sonic cleaning system is much faster, and does a much better job. Thanks for the help UPC."

> **Kenneth Pope, Pope Instrument Repair, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts:**
> "A tool that does the job better, faster and safer - what's not to like? To say that I am fully satisfied with my tank is a huge understatement. I switched from using acids and degreasers in the hope of finding something environmentally friendly - and my Ultrasonic Tank is that and so much more."

> **Bob Fleming, Flemings Music Shop, Fresno California:**
> "UltraSonic cleaning has them all beat for ease of use, great results, and environmental safety."

> **Pam Shellenberger, Tigard Music, Vancouver, Washington:**
> "It's fast. Parts are cleaner in a fraction of the time, with little or no scrubbing. It's versatile and safe on brass, nickel, silverplate, clarinet keys and plastic...it's better on the environment and personnel. Chemicals are benign and very dilute. It's ergonomic; moves easily and is back-friendly."

> **Thomas Music, Rochester, NY:**
> "Very fast - 3 minutes - cleans all the 'nooks and crannies' because the entire instrument is submerged in the tank. Our small shop has experienced a substantial increase in business from individuals and school districts because they want their instruments thoroughly cleaned. Outstanding 'tech support' provided by Ultrasonic Power Corp. The cost of the machine was recovered in less than one year!"

> **Joe, Rita, Perry, The Saxophone Place, Tupelo, MS:**
> "We would not consider operating daily without the Ultrasonic Cleaning machine. Brass instruments will last longer and taking off buffing rouge has never been easier."

> **Jeff Vovakes, Vermont Music:**
> "Not only does it do a superior job, but it has allowed us to discontinue the use of some potentially hazardous products reducing health risks and disposal costs."

> **Noreen Garza, US Navy:**
> "We have had our ultrasonic cleaner for 20 years, and it is still working."
