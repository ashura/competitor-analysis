## Featured Products

L. Brügge­mann GmbH & Co. KG's featured products center around their BRUGGOLEN® line of high-performance additives for technical plastics, especially polyamides (PA 6, PA 6.6, PA 12, and copolyamides), polyesters, and polyolefins.

**Major product categories and highlights:**

1. **Heat Stabilizers**
   - Classic copper-salt heat stabilizers (e.g., BRUGGOLEN® H320/H321, H324/H325, H328F/H329F) for polyamides, offering long-term heat protection up to 180°C.
   - Modern copper iodide stabilizers (BRUGGOLEN® TP-H1607, TP-H1804, TP-H1805) for higher temperature resistance (up to 230°C for PA6.6).
   - Copper-complex stabilizers (BRUGGOLEN® H3386/H3387, H3350/H3351, H3376/H3377) for long-term stabilization and natural color retention.

2. **Processing Agents**
   - Nucleating agents (BRUGGOLEN® P22 for polyamides, P252 for polyesters, TP-P1401 granulate) for improved flow, dimensional stability, and mechanical properties.
   - Flow improvers (BRUGGOLEN® P1507, TP-P1810, TP-P2201) that enhance melt flow without affecting mechanical properties.
   - Combination internal/external lubricants (BRUGGOLEN® P14, P130).
   - Processing One-Packs and auxiliary agents for recycling and optimized processing.

3. **Modifiers**
   - Chain extenders (BRUGGOLEN® M1251, M1253) to increase molecular weight for better impact strength and elongation.
   - Chain breakers (BRUGGOLEN® M1417) for controlled viscosity adjustment in recycling polyamide waste.

4. **Impact Modifiers**
   - Compoline® CO/PA series (from subsidiary Auserpolimeri) to improve impact properties and mechanical performance, functionalized for different needs and extreme temperatures (down to -40°C).

5. **Light Stabilizers**
   - BRUGGOLEN® L11 (optical brightener + stabilizer), L20, and L206 for color stability and UV protection in engineering thermoplastics.

6. **Recycling Additives for Polyolefins**
   - BRUGGOLEN® R8895 for upcycling polypropylene from car battery cases.
   - BRUGGOLEN® TP-R2090 and TP-R2162 for upcycling polypropylene and polyethylene from post-industrial and post-consumer waste streams, using proprietary "repair technology" to restore polymer chain quality and mechanical properties.
