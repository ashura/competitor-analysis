The company annually completes an ESG analysis using EDCI (ESG Data Convergence Initiative Emissions Reporting) for GHG emissions and the SASB standards relevant to medical device manufacturers. The ESG analysis benchmarks AirLife's performance in areas such as product safety, ethics, design lifecycle management, and supply chain management, and is reported to the board of directors.

- For 2023: Scope 1 emissions increased to 1,853 tCO2e, Scope 2 increased to 14,936 tCO2e, and Scope 3 emissions are still not yet measured (Total: 16,789 tCO2e).

To progress toward Net Zero by 2050, AirLife has initiated environmental management measures, including:
- Manufacturing products for the UK at an ISO 14001 certified plant
- Reducing and improving packaging sustainability through a new carton project
- Advocating for LED lighting and electric vehicle charging at headquarters
- Shipping directly to UK customers to reduce logistics emissions
- Promoting remote/web-based meetings to cut travel
- Providing educational materials to employees on Net Zero and environmental responsibilities
