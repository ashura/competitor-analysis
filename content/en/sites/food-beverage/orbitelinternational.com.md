## Environment / Society / Governance

ORBITEL INTERNATIONAL has demonstrated a commitment to ESG-related initiatives through its product innovation and development. On the environmental side, the company has launched the O’scallion plant-based meat product line, including plant-based pork belly slice (Gua Bao) and braised pork sauce, which contributes to more sustainable food solutions by offering alternatives to animal proteins. This can help reduce the carbon footprint and resource use typically associated with animal agriculture. However, there is no explicit disclosure on specific environmental metrics, social impact programs, or details of governance practices on public pages. Their core values emphasize innovation, quality, and making products accessible globally, but direct investment or achievement data related to ESG is limited.
