## Environment / Society / Governance

Based on the information available on the official website of TAI TSUANG OIL SEAL INDUSTRY CO., LTD, there is limited direct disclosure regarding comprehensive ESG (environment, society, and corporate governance) practices.

1. TTO has developed and marketed a range of "Low Friction Material" products since 2015 to meet the needs of the electric vehicle market and to reduce friction within mechanical systems. This innovation contributes to improved energy efficiency and potentially less environmental impact due to lower wear and energy consumption.
