## Testimonials

> “Setup is straightforward with Kramer Control. That’s why we gravitated towards this system. Kramer has the ‘full-stack’ more than anyone else on the market, especially when it comes to the drivers being pre-written.”
>
> — Aaron Jackson, AV Technical and Integration Support Lead, Tulalip Resort Casino

> “We grew much faster than we had anticipated, so we looked to Sierra Video Systems again to upgrade and expand. We originally chose Sierra Video products because of their reliability and a price point that fit our budget. We haven’t had a single moment of downtime from any of the equipment, so when we wanted to transition to a larger system we looked to Sierra Video.”
