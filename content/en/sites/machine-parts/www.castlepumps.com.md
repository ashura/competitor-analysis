> "Castle Pumps are a very competitive and efficient supplier. Their quotations are always very prompt and accurate, with important information regarding the spares and lead times. Follow up when placing orders is always very quick and informative. Goods are always of a good quality and as requested. Nothing is ever too much trouble for them."

> "We recently placed an Order with Castle Pumps Ltd for Coupling Bushes. We placed the initial enquiry for 3 sets (9 pieces per set) and then placed the Order for 3 sets (9 Pieces per set). The Order arrived and we found we had received 18 pieces. ... As we are very much in the customer service business ourselves we find their response, level or service and aftercare very poor indeed. As a customer we often return as a repeat customer to many companies throughout the world. We will not be returning to Castle Pumps Ltd nor will we recommend them to any company that we deal with and would recommend to anyone looking to place an order with them to beware."
